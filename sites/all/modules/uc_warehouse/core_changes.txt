uc_quote.pages.inc
- uc_quote_request_quotes changed to call the warehouse fucntions to build possible packages

index.php
The index.php file in the Drupal root has been altered to include a custom class.  I am storing an array of
instances of the custom class Warehouse.  Therefore the Warehouseclass needs defined before any session work
is done otherwise the object give the __PHP_Incomplete_Class Object error.
