Ubercart Disable Store
=========
The Ubercart Disable Store module adds the ability to disable Ubercart store (hide/disable add to cart, etc) for some conditions. 

Ex. Wholesaler requires Reseller Accounts to shop: If your website should display Ubercart products but only allow show Add to Cart forms for certain roles, for instance, then this module is for you.


Installation
============
1. Install & enable the module.

2. Configure Permissions (admin/user/permissions).
   Ubercart Disable Store provides a permission that allows only some roles
   to see the Add to Cart form in views and product node output. Users in roles
   with the 'enable store checkout' permission will be able to use Add to Cart.


Future
============
This is intentionally a very simple module.  Future additional features might include more granular Ubercart blocking like hiding the 'cart' path and implementing more triggers other than just role-based disabling of the storefront.
